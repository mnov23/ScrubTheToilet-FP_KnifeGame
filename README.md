# ScrubTheToilet-FP_KnifeGame
Project on hold while I learn some Blender 3D modelling on the side.

project revived and still being slowly... disappointingly developed, chipped at with snail 🐌 like slow pace that puts Yandere Dev to shame. 

blogposting in readme because my intuition tells me there are even more people who are privvy to this project. 

some kind of feedback is needed regardless. 
I'm slowing down my pace of commits and keeping it local on my machine. 

when I will have something worthwhile to show, I will do so. 

until then, patience....
