/* handcrafted documentation: 
 * 
 *    0 or 1 -> into CabinTransition Animation scene....
 *    
 *    
 *    subject to changes as the project goes....

*       this is the Genshin Impact :trademark: feature login screen
*       which is a True work of Art
*       the moment my friend showed my what the Genshin Impact login screen looked like,
*       ...I instantly fell in love with the game and realized I'm there to stay for a good eternity.
*       I overstayed my welcome in Genshin Impact for ~2 years
*       many waifus were whaled on my burning Savings account
*       combined with a horrible personal life past...
*       and no hope for future...
*       
*       it was a personal Hell of my own making.
*       
*       I caught 'em all waifus.
*       then I gave away my account to the most toxic person in that community I was part of. For free.
*       and alleviated myself of that burden.
*       
*       needless to say, I am not returning back into Gayming.
*       But I will make Games for other people to enjoy.
*       I'm in it for the money. Sorry to disappoint you, but I am coming into Gamedev with the Triple "A" (AAA) philosophy.
*       you won't see any Indie Game Dev creativity here. Nor any revolutionary, meta changing games, nor any timeless classics immortalized into eternity.
*       
*       
*       Genshin Impact login style... A Camera is panned out to the Object.
*       The Camera pans in closer to the Object, a doorway opens into the magical La-la-land that will suck all of your spare time
*       and consume your Soul. If the game is genuinely good, it will be time that you will wish to WASTE by your free will.
*       If the game is bad, it won't take away too much of your time.
*       Regardless, Mobile Games are a time-sink to waste your time as you sit in a queue and do your adult chores like paying your bills or going to a doctor for a checkup.
*       
*       The ads won't feed my empty stomach. They are there to irritate you. And to let me have a passive income and a working Banking System to payroll my future (already presently recruited) 3D artist.
*       
 *    I am still open to employement opportunities in South Africa or overseas (GMT+2 timezone), even willing to work with a different timezone.
 *    I'm at best a Junior Software Developer, but my life matters too. (Flexible on position and terms; I have a wide range of talents.)
 *    Just like everybody else out there, I want to pay my bills.

 
 *    vers. 2 of vibe coded script.
 *    
 *    many, many, many more edits to be included.
