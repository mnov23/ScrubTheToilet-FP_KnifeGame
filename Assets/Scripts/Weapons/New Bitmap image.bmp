3 weapons so far...
katana, because I don't want to depreciate the work of my 3d artist...
fork, because it was the original idea...
and knife, because knife is similar to katana.

more is needed for variety of gameplay and player's progress as they invest into the game.

all of them should share the same animation to reusability and ease of developing...
meaning all of them should be stabbing/scratching objects.

unless I wish to expand the game. (more work)
