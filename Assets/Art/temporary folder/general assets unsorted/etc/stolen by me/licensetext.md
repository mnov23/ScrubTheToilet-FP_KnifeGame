I don't own any of those....
They are here purely to experimental and learn how to use Unity.

They will be deleted upon release of a working demo.
Any trace of those files in my repositories and commit history are not a valid form of intellectual property theft. (c)

I solemly swear that the final version of my product will not include any stolen art or intellectual property of other corpos.
I bear no responsibility for people cloning and creating branches of my Github repository with this art being used elsewhere to smear me or frame me.

I'd even put MIT license here, but it won't be necessary.
Those files will be quietly deleted and removed from public eyes.
