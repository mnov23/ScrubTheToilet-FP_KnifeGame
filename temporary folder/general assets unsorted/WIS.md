<h3 align="center">Early in my career as a developer, a seasoned engineer told me: First, make it, then, make it work, lastly, if you can, make it pretty. That approach saved me a ton of time.</h3>

1st, make it.   no matter how crappy it is.   
Structure is more important.

then, make it work.                                     
Because non-working software is trash.

lastly, if you can, make it pretty.              
This is where art goes....
